# Lattices for LDPC Code

This project explores the combination of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes with Construction A lattices to improve error correction performance in communication systems. By analyzing various code configurations across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), we evaluate Word Error Rate (WER) performance. The study focuses on optimizing code rates to achieve robust error correction while maintaining efficient communication throughput.

The experiment demonstrated that higher code rates (e.g., k = 540) provided the best WER performance across most SNR levels. This shows that denser lattices with smaller decision regions can reduce decoding errors, making the configuration with k = 540 ideal for high-rate communication systems.
